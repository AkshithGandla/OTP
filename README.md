# OTP

## Introduction

>Disclaimer: I am not a complete expert in these topics lol, but what I can definitely do is help you become one. If I mention or suggest any topics or techniques which you feel are in-effecient, inept, or just outright stupid, freely and kindly point them out, I will do my best to correct them.

 * Fill out the "Introduction" google form which I will shortly send.
 * First things first, maintain a good sitting posture, a decent chair and a table, do not stare continuously on screens. If possible start getting fit if not already (else you will regret having that fat/thin belly one you go to goa in your final year lol)
 * Get prepared to google and youtube a lot, like a lot.
 * My primary job is to tell you keyword terms, your job is to google it and find out why where when what how.
 * By default I am gonna assume you are not familliar with most of the technologies needed.

### Before first call

* If not used git already, download it, use it, break it, make branches, send pull requests, try the frightening rebase command, make your fellow developer hate you, etc...
* Setup an root Amazon Web services Account (compulsary) https://console.aws.amazon.com/ , you will get free trial for 1 year, if used within limits it shouldn't cost you a dime.
* Learn to write basic hello world in javascript (for while loops, let var const scoping, JSON, Objects, if else) use https://javascript.info/ . It would be awesome if you can look into promises, async await, npm.
* Learn to write basic hello world in python and boto3 SDK.
* Explore AWS account using the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ and/or google/youtube/duckduckgo/ecosia whatever.
* Checkout these things (and their pricing)
  * S3
  * Lambda functions
  * API Gateway
  * EC2 instances
  * Billing
  * IAM roles, groups, the concept in general
  * Dynamo DB
  * SES
  * SQS
  * Cloudfront CDN
  * Nginx
  * Postman
* Its ok if you dont touch each and every topic, but try to see them all at least once, even a couple of lines wouldn't hurt.
* Using the above tools and concepts, **propose a data flow diagram, for making an operational OTP system in our first call**, feel free to suggest anything you want, try to also keep in mind scalabilty(should be able to handle say, 10000 request/sec), fault tolerance(what if once server blasts), if you want you can also look into chaos engineering and how backend of netflix works(its bloody beautiful), the 2007 paper of dynamoDB is also nice, if you are intrested, also read about the CAP theorem.
* You can get my contact on my linkedin profile, feel free to whatsapp/email. If whatsapp is too personal we can use google chats/hangouts or else slack.
